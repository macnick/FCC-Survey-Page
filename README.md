# freeCodeCamp: Survey Form

This is my Survey Form page for freeCodeCamp's second [basic front end project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) created for an imaginary company. Demo is available [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/macnick/full/YJErGL). The form works. If you submit it I will get a message with all the data.

# freeCodeCamp: Survey Form

This is my Survey Form page for freeCodeCamp's second [basic front end project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) created for an imaginary company. Demo is available [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/macnick/full/YJErGL).

## Install and Build

Nothing to install, just clone this repo and you are good to go.

#### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/macnick/FCC-Tribute-Page.git
cd FCC-Tribute-Page
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start dev server with browser sync

It builds HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript bundle, starts a dev server and refreshes the browser on every changes.

```bash
npm start
```

#### Build production bundle

It uglifies JS, minifies CSS and images, replaces references to non-optimized scripts and stylesheets in HTML files and copies everything necessary to the `dist` folder - ready to upload.

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Preview production build

It's the same as the build task above but it also starts a server so you can check your work.

```bash
npm run preview
```
